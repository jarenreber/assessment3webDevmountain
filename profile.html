                <p>As a native to Utah I have a passion for the outdoors and working hard. Growing up in a changing world I have been able to learn a variety of skills. Technology has always been a friend of mine and I have been able to advance my knowledge extensively as of recent while attending a bootcamp for Web Development at Devmountain. It is my goal to pair my hard working attitude with what I learn at Devmountain to become a full stack developer and work in one of the many growing tech companies here in Utah. </p>
